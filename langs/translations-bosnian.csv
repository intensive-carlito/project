"Metro #12 역이 바로 앞에 있고, Duroc 역이 걸어서 10분내에 있는 등 교통편이 용이하고, 까르프 마트도 바로 옆에 있어 생필품 구매 등도 용이합니다. 단지, 숙소 크기, 청결도 및 주방용구 등이 많이 낡음 등이 단점이 있습니다. 특히 카페트 및 침대보 등이 청결하지 않은 것 같습니다. 오실 때 꼭 간이실내화 등 가져오시면 좋은 갓 같습니다. 가성비는 보통이지만, 파리시내로 가는 교통 편이성을 우선순위로 고려하신다면 나쁘지 않을 것 같습니다.",1,bosnian,ko-en,"Metro #12 station right in front, Danemark walk to the Railway Station, 10 minutes, such as transportation, how self Reg can buy necessities, etc. Just, stay, size, cleanliness and kitchen tools, including a lot of old no drawbacks.

무엇보다 위치가 마음에 들었던곳. 오페라에서 걸어도 15분정도 (공항에서 Roissy Bus를 이용하여 시내로 들어갈 경우 Opera 에서 Metro를 이용하기보다 캐리어끌고 걸어도 다닐만한 거리에 위치) 그리고 중심가에서 들고날기가 쉽고, 이곳저곳을 다닐때 Bus stop위치가 good!, 몽마르트는걸어가도,,,
파리 특유의 허접해 보이는 건물외관에 비하여 실내가 새로 renovation 하여 깨끗하고, 무엇보다 안전한 위치, 거주환경이었던 곳. 
두,세명정도의 파리를 여행한다면 추천해드리고 싶은 숙소중 하나입니다.",1,bosnian,ko-en,"South France trip in a few days stay in Paris. This year, the South of France via a short schedule as Paris. In the meantime I name several kinds of accommodations available was very close to the hotel stay and thought the place was.

"Dobra lokacija uz sve potrebno za prezivljavanje prilikom istrazivanja Pariza. Los krevet i nedostatak zabavnih sadrzaja (tv). Znaci, stan je super  za kolko tolko se naspavat, prespavat noc i nesto pojest. Ako ste prvi put u Parizu i vise nego dovoljno.",1,bosnian,hr-en,"Good location near everything you need to prezivljavanje with studies of Paris. Los bed and the lack of entertainment facilities (TV). Signs, the apartment is perfect for how much money you naspavat, great value for the night and something. If you are in Paris for the first time and more than enough."
Prima!,1,bosnian,it-en,First!
집앞에 bar가 많고 슈퍼가 있어서 좋았다. 숙소는 진짜 깨끗했다. 호스트가 썰명츙이셨다. 세탁기 냉장고 있다했는데 우리가 떠날때가 되어서야 가져왔다. 그래도 친절하셨음. 화장실좋음. 앞집이 밤에 시끄럽게했다. 그거빼면 다굳~,1,bosnian,ko-en,"The house in front of the bar much super you have. The hostel is really clean. Host sled description 츙. Washing machine fridge. did we leave then that brought. So friendly, helpful and nice. The toilet too. The night loudly. It is a bit different.~"
Sin ningún problema.,1,bosnian,es-en,Without any problem.
"Odlična lokacija, pogotovo za mlade, s mnogo restorana i mjesta za izlazak u neposrednoj blizini apartmana. Smještaj u staroj pariškoj zgradi poseban je doživljaj,  samo što pogled kroz prozor nije očaravajući.  Apartman je vrlo čist, a vlasnica je izuzetno susretljiva i draga osoba.",1,bosnian,hr-en,"Great location, especially for Teens, with lots of restaurants and places to go within easy reach from the property. Stay in an old Parisian building, is a special experience, only that the view out the window fascinating. The apartment is very clean, the hostess is very far and expensive."

"在这家民宿住的非常舒服!
对面是地铁5号线,走几分钟是地铁1号线,巴黎挺小的,靠地铁可以玩转市区,住这里完全够了｡
家里什么都有,洗衣机,洗衣液,熨斗,吹风机,咖啡机,微波炉,冰箱,雨伞……甚至各种厨具,灶台……我和我的小伙伴还在这里做饭了｡每周四每周日,民宿门口就是巴士底集市,有非常本土化的小吃和食材,如果想体验当地生活一定不要错过｡
床也非常软,是真的软,累了一天躺倒床上非常有幸福感｡
来之前还担心过安全问题,来之后觉得这间民宿位置比较幽静,在我入住期间,没有发生任何不愉快的事情｡
房东似乎不在巴黎,把房门钥匙交给了一个机构,房客需要和这个机构的工作人员对接,刚好和我们对接的是一个中国留学生,入住完全无障碍!

如果还来巴黎,我很有可能还会住这里,唯一感到困扰的是,入住时间比较严格,也无法提前来安置行李｡但似乎巴黎民宿都是这样的｡这个房子有个超大的落地窗,但是落地窗上疑似锁坏了,好在有个卷帘门,但还是存在一定的安全隐患,不确定这个卷帘门能不能从外面打开｡如果要预定,可以提前跟房东确认落地窗锁的问题｡

如果满分100分,个人体验可以给这家民宿打上80分!
感谢房东eric!",1,bosnian,zh-en,"In this house live very comfortable!
The opposite is the Subway Line 5,a few minutes away is the subway line No. 1,Paris is quite small,against the subway can be fun for the city,a stay here is completely enough to the room.
The House has everything,washing machine,Laundry detergent,iron,Hairdryer,coffee maker,microwave,refrigerator,umbrella...... Even a variety of kitchen utensils,hob...... Me and my friends are still here cooking up as well. Week four Sunday,B & B door is the Bastille market,a very local snacks and ingredients,if you want to experience the local life don't necessarily miss home.
The bed is also very soft,really soft,tired a day lying in bed a very happy sense of home.
To before also worried about security issues,to After think this homestay location is secluded,in my stay,did not happen any unpleasant things home.
The landlord did not seem to be Paris,turn the door key handed over to an Agency,the tenant needs and the Agency's staff butt,just, and our docking is a Chinese International Student,check-in is completely disabled!

If you come to Paris,I'm likely to also will live here,only to feel bothered,check-in time is relatively strict,but also cannot advance to accommodate the Luggage area. But it seems that Paris bed and Breakfast are like this. This house has a large floor to ceiling Windows,but floor to ceiling Windows on the suspected lock is broken,luckily I have a roller door,but still there are some security risks,not to determine the rolling door can not be opened from the outside area. If you want to book,can in advance with the landlord to confirm the floor-to-ceiling lock the problem area.

If out of 100 points,personal experience can give this property on 80 points!
Thanks to the landlord, eric!"

"Denis je izuzetno ljubazan domaćin. Dočekao nas je i dao nam osnovna uputstva o tome kako stići do glavnih atrakcija. Apartman je upravo onakav kako je opisan na sajtu, vrlo povoljan s obzirom da ima posebnu spavaću sobu. Metro 12 je odmah preko puta, kao i samoposluga, a metro 4 u blizini, tako da je odlična veza do bilo kog kraja Pariza.
Apartman je na 6 katu bez lifta, i to treba imati u vidu za goste koji se teško penju ili imaju puno prtljaga.",1,bosnian,hr-en,"Denis is a very kind host. Welcomed us and gave us basic instructions on how to get to the main attractions. The apartment is exactly as described on website, very beneficial, given that has a special bedroom. 12 metro just across the road as the supermarket and metro next 4, so it's an excellent touch to any end of Paris.
The apartment is on the 6th floor without Elevator, and it should be borne in mind for guests that are difficult to climb or have a lot of Luggage."

"我们在夏天最热的时候来到了这里,房间小小的,只有一面窗,没有对流的空气,所以真的是非常非常的热｡除了没有缓解高温的空调和风扇其它东西还是很齐全的,但是主人可能离开时很匆忙,所以只是把床单被罩什么的堆在一起并没有整理好;而且也没有准备好诸如厕纸,洗手液,洗洁精,食盐等东西;还在我们仍然租住的过程中回来拿过东西｡房子的位置挺好的,周围有公交车,地铁和夜班车;街口有超市和披萨店;离共和国广场和运河也不远｡感谢房东让我们住了那么久,让我们可以有一个亲近巴黎的base.",1,bosnian,zh-en,"We in the summer the hottest time here,the room small,only one side of the window,there is no convection of air,it really is very, very hot area.
