숙소 위치를 상세하게 안내해줘서 잘 찾을 수 있었네용 방이 좀 좁긴 했지만 바로 옆에 뭐 먹을 수 있는 공간이랑 냉장고도 있어서 좋았어요. 화장실 공용이었는데 저희가 아침 일찍 준비해서 그런가 겹치게 사용한 적이 없어서 단독 욕실 같고 편리했어요. 집도 예쁘고 깨끗해서 좋았어요. 집이 있는 거리도 깨끗하고 조용하고 바로 근처에 역이 있어서 이동하기에도 편리했습니다. 그런데 토요일 밤에 뭔지 모르겠는데 위층?윗집?에서 너무 쿵쿵거리고 음악 틀고 진짜 시끄럽더라고요 피곤했어소 잘 자긴 했는데 예민하신 분들은 잠 못 잘 정도였는데 뭔지는 잘 모르겠어요.. 이 날 빼고는 엄청 조용하고 잘 지냈습니당 방 자체는 그렇게 안 넓고 좁습니당,1,breton,ko-en,"Accommodation and location details to guide me in the well was able to find my way a little narrow, but right next to what you can eat space love refrigerators.

"방이 매우 아늑하고 편안합니다. 리옹역에서 매우 가깝습니다. 그리고 호스트 Anna는 저희의 숙박 기간에 최대한 편안하게 해주셨습니다. 하나 알아야 할 부분은 엘리베이터가 없다는 점입니다. 무거운 캐리어가 있는 사람은 꼭 신경쓰셔야 할 부분입니다. 

결론적으로 매우 좋았습니다^^",1,breton,ko-en,"The room is very cozy and comfortable. Lyon station in very close. And the host Anna is our stay as comfortable as possible. One should know the part is there is no Elevator. Heavy carrier is a person who has come care you need.

Très bon séjour chez Maguy,1,breton,fr-en,Very good stay with Maguy
"사진과 똑같은 깔끔한 시설은 기본이고, 큰 창문이 있어 항상 채광이 좋았습니다. 발코니에 있는 꽃 화분들은 유럽의 변덕스런 날씨에도 불구하고 집 분위기를 화사하게 해주는 듯 합니다.   
창문은 푸른 정원을 바라보고 있어 경치가 평온합니다. 
특히나 아침에 귀를 기울이면 정원에서 속삭이는 새소리를 들을 수 있습니다. 아마 아무리 좋은 호텔에서도 이런 경험은 없을 듯 싶군요.^^

숙소 바로 근처에 지하철역과 버스정류장이 있어 파리 시내 주요 핫스팟은 어디든지 편하고 쉽게 갈 수 있었구요. 마트도 가까이 있고 맛난 베이커리와 카페도 매우 가까이 있어서 편리했습니다. 동네도 조용한 고급 주택가인지라 밤늦은 시간에도 마음 편하게 다닐 수 있었습니다.  

출발하기 전부터 호스트분에게 많은 문의를 드렸는데, 항상 친절하게 잘 답변해 주시고, 여행 7일동안 불편한 사항은 없는지 항상 신경써 주시고, 여행중 궁금한 사항은 언제든지 물어보고 유용한 답변을 즉시 받을 수 있었습니다. 마지막날 항공편 때문에 늦은 체크아웃까지 배려해주시고, 다시 한번 감사드립니다!
언제든 다시 오고 싶은 곳입니다.^^",1,breton,ko-en,"The photo in the same neat, facilities are basic and the large window, there is always light good. Balcony with flowers in pots, they are Europe's capricious weather, despite the home atmosphere bright that seemed. 
The window is a lush garden view and the tranquility. 
Especially in the morning to help in the garden whispering birdsong can be heard. Probably no good hotel in this experience there is no seemed to want to.^^

The hostel is right near the subway station and the bus stop is Paris the city's main hotspots wherever to easily go. Mart was close and delicious bakery and cafe is also very close. The neighborhood is also quiet high class residential. night time also put your mind at ease that I could. 

Before departure from host to many of the young, always friendly well answers to, and Travel 7 days inconveniences are not always cares, and, travel questions at any time to ask a useful answer immediately. The last day of flight because of the late check-out up to, thank you!
At any time want to come back.^^"

Séjour agréable chez Nathanael,1,breton,fr-en,Enjoyable stay with Nathanael
"租赁这套房间是我这次旅游中最不快乐的事情｡收了与房租一样多的定金不说,还要在早上7点到9点半退房太不合理,还有要打扫房间与入住时一样干净太过份了｡说好9点半来做checkout等到10点钟还不来浪费我们时间,更让人气愤的是说我们把挂毛巾的架子弄坏了,要赔偿110欧元简直是抢钱｡估计是设得圈套,有谁吃得空故意去损坏毛巾架呀!太气愤了!
要是谁看到我的评论,千万别去租这里的房子,我们就是前车之鉴!",1,breton,zh-en,"Lease this Suite room is I this tour the most unhappy things home. Charged with the rent as much of the Deposit do not say,also want to in the morning 7 point to 9 point half of the check-out is too irrational,as well as to clean the room and stay as clean as too much area. Deal 9 points of the half to do the checkout, wait until 10 o'clock also not to waste our time,more let popular anger of Be say we hang the towel rack broke,have to pay 110 euros is simply to grab the money available. The estimate is set to be a snare,who eat empty deliberately to damage the towel rack! Too angry!
If who see my comments,don't go rent a house here,we is a lesson!"
"我最终决定用中文完成评论｡作为一个诚实的反馈,我想先说说该房产的优点:
从装修上看,这是一个现代的房产｡除了马桶盖掉了外,其他家具都很有特色,大多使用时间并不久,很干净｡
从沟通角度看,房主是一个热情好客的人,从预定成功到入住到决定不住,他紧密跟进过程,提供线索｡
再来说说缺点:
说实话,我最终决定宁可不要400多块,也不住这个房子,当然我们没吵架｡我只是提醒所有用airbnb的人都注意---看一个民宿时,请更多注意一下差评是否可以接受｡
既然我没有住,一定有我不可接受的原因｡这个民宿是由一个地下室和一层走廊,一个后接的平房组成｡地下室部分是卧室,由一个旋转楼梯和地面连接｡我入住当天还有一户人家要入住｡进入卧室后,一股浓重的潮气扑面而来,有一个抽风机在呼呼得工作,旋梯立陡,孩子下去要很小心｡我一下子就想,这样的地方如果有意外都逃不出去｡我想要的异域风情一下子被更重要的安全意识所覆盖｡
院门和屋门之间的房顶是塑料布盖着的,塑料布破了,有点漏雨,屋门没锁,院门不结实,同时不好锁｡我不知道巴黎的安全性怎样,但是这样的门给我的感觉很差很差｡
我们转了一圈,都看了一遍,然后决定安全第一,宁可损失400多欧,也要住合格的酒店,于是转身去订酒店了｡
事后我在想:如果我早知道这个房子卧室在地下?如果我早早认真看评论中的差评?何至于让一家4口和我奔波在异乡街头?出门在外,安全第一,我怎么可以这么随性?
最后还要说,这间民宿对于喜欢地下室卧室和合租的驴友是一个好选择｡
我只看到地下室的两个卧室,不知道另一户住哪里?难道他们住在我们旁边?
没见到房东,听说他很热情｡他说地下室不潮,不知道那个换气扇为什么一直开着?",1,breton,zh-en,"I eventually decided to use Chinese to complete the comments area. As an honest feedback,I want to first talk about the property advantages:
From the decoration on the see,this is a modern property and great views. In addition to the toilet seat cover fell off,the other furniture are very unique,most of the use of time is not long,very clean and great views.
From the communication perspective,the homeowner is a hospitable person,from reservation to check-in to the decision to live,he closely followed up the process,provide clues as well.
And then to talk about the disadvantages:
To be honest,my final decision would rather not more than 400 blocks,also don't live in this house,of course we have no quarrel with House. I just remind all my people that---look at a b & b,please pay more attention about the bad review whether it would be acceptable as well.
Since I did not live,certainly has me unacceptable reasons as well. This B & B is composed of a basement and a corridor,one after the Bungalow the composition of the House. The basement part is the bedrooms,by a staircase and the ground connection area. I check-in the day and a family to stay home. Into the bedroom after,a surge of strong moisture blowing,there is a blower in the whirring got to work,ladder stand steep,the child is going to be very careful as well. I immediately thought,such a place if there are escape to go home. I want a exotic all at once is more important the safety consciousness of the covered area.
Court of Justice of the door and the door between the roof is plastic sheeting covered with,plastic sheeting broken,a little leaky,the doors didn't lock,the gate is not strong,while the bad locked areas. I don't know Paris safety how,but this door gave me the feeling very poor very poor area.
We turn a circle,looked again,then decided to safety first,rather the loss of more than 400 Euro,also want to live a qualified property,then turned around to booking the hotel room.
Afterwards I thought:if I had known this house bedroom in the basement? If I Early seriously look at the comments of a bad review? What as to let a 4 port and I run around in a foreign land the street? Go out in the outside,safety first,How can I be so casual?
And finally to say,this homestay for like the basement bedroom and rent the mix is a good choice as well.
I see only the basement of two bedrooms,don't know the other users live where? Do they live next to us?
Didn't see the landlord,heard he's very welcoming home. He said the basement is not the Tide,don't know that a ventilation fan why always open?"

"유럽여행의 마지막이 파리였는데, 숙소가 메우 깨끗해서 좋았습니다. 예상한데로 그리 넓지는 않지만, 둘이 지내기에 딱 적당했어요. 
오를리 샤를드골 모두 지하철로 바로 올수 있고 역에서도 매우 가까워서 이동이 엄청 편했습니다.
저희 같은 경우는 자전거로 이동을 해서 현관에서 나오면 바로 velib 자전거를 이용할수 있다는 점도 너무 편리했구요.
현관도 2중 보안장치가 있어서 매우 안전했고, 집앞에 카페가 있어서 늦게까지 가벼운 맥주한잔 하기에도 좋았습니다.
여러모로 매우 만족스러웠고, 다시 파리에 오게 된다면 또 이용할 생각입니다.
다만 2층 침대가 조금 불편했고, 1층에 소파베드을 사용하려 했지만, 시트가 청소가 되어 있지 않더군요. 청소 하시는분께 2명만 왔다고 예기해서 2층 침대만 사용한다고 생각했나봐요. 미리 소파베드 청소도 말씀하시면, 시트를 미리 교체해 주실거 같네요.

"조금 좁다고 느낄 수도 있지만 매우 아담하고 깨끗한 집이었습니다. 햇빛도 잘 들어오고, 따뜻한 물도 잘 나와서 지내기 좋았습니다. Alien은 정말 친절하고 궁금한 거에 대해서 질문을 하면 거의 30분 내에 답변을 해주어서 편리했습니다. 에펠탑까지도 5~10분 내로 갈 수 있는 거리라 편리하고, 이쪽 동네가 다른 동네에 비해서 안전한 동네인 것 같았습니다. 단, 한가지 아쉬웠던 점은 파리의 아파트가 대부분 그런건지 모르겠지만, 집까지 올라가는 계단이 좁고 높아서 무거운 캐리어를 들고 올라가는 것은 좀 힘들었습니다. 그래도 결론적으로는 매우 만족스러운 숙소였습니다.",1,breton,ko-en,"A little narrow and might feel but very cozy and clean house. Sit and warm water, also well and good. Alien is really friendly and curious about questions for nearly 30 minutes to answer. The Eiffel Tower even 5 to 10 minutes you can go to the street convenient, this neighborhood is another neighborhood in a safe neighborhood it seemed. However, one inconvenient point is that Paris apartment is for the most part that I don't know, but the house up the stairs narrow and high and heavy get is a little tough. So in conclusion a very satisfactory stay."

처음에는 도심이랑 너무 멀지 않을까 걱정 많이 했는데 20~30분정도면 도심으로 바로 갈 수 있어서 너무 좋더라구요! 그리고 저희는 집근처 지하철 7호선만 타고 다녔습니다 7호선에서 집까지 걸어오는데 전혀 무섭지 않아요! 집시들도 없구요 한국의 일산..?? 같은 느낌이랄까..?? 오히려 soum네 동네가 치안은 좋은거 같아요! 나중에는 여자둘이 배짱생겨서 새벽 한 시에 숙소에 들어갔답니다 ㅋㅋㅋ
7호선타면 루브르까지 바로 가고, 버스타면 몽마르트언덕까지도 바로 갈 수 있어요!!

Initially, the city of love not too far away and I'm worried the lot was 20 to 30 minutes to the city center as you can go, too.

Rather, the soum of four neighborhood policing is like. Later in our guts play in the Dawn time in the place entered. ㅋㅋㅋ
Line 7 to the Louvre right up until, the Montmartre hill until you can go right!!
And near the Carrefour so daily in the morning and evening to eat~! Soum too friendly and nice with you♡ generously recommended.^^"

"我们第一次选择尝试airbnb住宿,体验巴黎当地local 生活｡由于是蜜月假期,我们对行程期待很高｡整个行程也很小心,白天游览巴黎,仅仅只是晚上很晚回来洗漱睡觉｡我们也在巴黎度过了愉快的3天｡而在第四天早上我们check out 时,由于头天晚上游船回家太晚,选择在第二天早上洗澡,洗完后就check out｡房东家洗漱间与卧室没有门,且洗澡的玻璃门里没有地方放肥皂,每次使用都要开门拿(洗澡空间小,转身都不便,确实不好放洗浴用品,你们如果入住应该会有相同体验),并且整个浴室就只有洗澡房里一个小孔排水,导致很容易积水,我和老公两个人洗完,在反复几次拿洗漱物品及衣服的同时,水流了一些到卫生间地上,由于卫生间没有一个排水孔,是的,一个都没有,并且与卧室相连没有门,水顺着流到了卧室,把床单的一角打湿了一点,我们整理床单时又把床沁湿了一点,我发誓只有一点点,当时巴黎是个大晴天,阳光明媚,房东进来查看我check out 怎么样了,我向房东问了两次我要不要把房间打扫一下,因为地上有些水｡房东说不用我们整理房间,并且强调有清洁工来打扫｡我当时觉得ok没问题了就出发去凡尔赛宫,等我们到凡尔赛宫买了票准备游览的时候,她突然疯了一般地给我打电话臭骂了我一顿,就只是因为我们洗澡的水从浴室渗出来打湿了地板...还在airbnb上投诉我们要我们赔偿200欧!不接受我们的道歉,只要钱!然后我们提出回去处理这个事情,她不让我们回去,她只要我们赔偿!并且我化妆用的粉屑掉了几粒在地上,她拍图片说我们把她的墙擦破了一点皮!天啊!我们住了3天都不敢碰她的墙!我发誓绝对没有!我感觉受到了侮辱,欺诈,欺骗!我们对房间的情况很了解,确实有些渗水,但并不严重｡我们最后还是把即将参观的凡尔赛丢在一边,返回把房间弄干,只用了20分钟不到,基本上我们回去,房间在巴黎的阳光下就已经干的差不多了｡又跟airbnb解释等等一系列,带着忐忑惊魂未定的心情反复确认回复,由于第一次使用airbnb,我们对整个回复处理流程并不熟练,我们很紧张,感觉受到了敲诈,我老公都准备报警了,弄完快3点了,已经没有时间再坐火车去凡尔赛了｡｡｡然而水渗出来是因为她浴室的排水系统不好好吗?浴室到卧室没有门,淋浴的地方没有置物架放洗浴用品,只能洗一半出来拿,再进去洗,加上排水系统不好,地上就很容易积水｡还好,后来airbnb是站在我们这边,没有让我们赔偿,她还真是狮子大开口,张嘴就要我们赔200欧,并且浪费了我们两人一共36欧的门票,来去两个人路费就不说了,加上反复联系打电话的费用,一共损失了大约50欧｡整个一天的行程和心情在来回的奔波中都泡了汤,让我们对巴黎印象都不好了｡在后面的行程中,住airbnb上的民俗也忐忑不安小心翼翼,严重影响了旅游体验与心情｡献上我最真实真诚的感受给大家,供大家参考｡",1,breton,zh-en,"The first time we choose to try airbnb,to experience Paris to its local life as well.

"우선 위치가 좋았습니다.

1월 첫째주 라서 가장 추운 계절이었기에 집안에 있는 히터 2개랑 집안에 있는 radiator 를 모두 키고 거실 조명만 켰을 뿐인데 바로 두꺼비 집이 나갔습니다.

5박 6일 머무르는 동안 거의 매일매일 조금만 전기를 쓰면 바로 두꺼비 집이 나갔습니다. 
그리고 이틀 후 부터는 거실에 있는 radiator 가 모두 꺼져버렸습니다.

이러한 문제들로 호스트와 연락을 시도했지만 제대로 답변을 주지 않았습니다.
동시에 여러가지 전자제품(히터, 헤어드라이기) 을 쓰면 그렇게 된다는 대답 뿐이었습니다. 
도대체 누가 히터를 끄고 집안 불을 모두 끄고 헤어드라이기를 쓰나요??

너무 화가나서 우리가 호스트에게 계속 따지고 연락을 시도했더니 
결국 호스트가 전기업자를 불러주긴 했으나 체크아웃 바로 전날 불러주었습니다...

그리고 전기업자가 말해주기를, 
이 집은 이미 전기를 여러개 동시에 못쓰도록 customized 해놓은 상태라고 하더군요...

제가 호스트에게는 절대 듣지 못한 말이었습니다. 
계속 전기를 동시에 여러개 쓰지 말라고만 말했습니다.

물론 호스트 입장에서 생각해보면 그렇게 해놓았을수 있다고 생각합니다.
그러면 미리 집에 대해 설명 해 놓을때 전기 내용에 대해 써있어야 하는거 아닌가요? 
결국은 
3명 가족이 모두 감기만 얻었습니다...

집 위치를 빼면 최악인 집이었습니다

여름에도 이렇겠지요 ??? ㅠㅠㅠ

1 November in the first round in the coldest season was set in the heater 2 The Love in your home, a radiator and both the key and the living room lights only turn on just the right toad house went out.

5 nights 6 days stay almost every day just a little bit ago to write the right toad house went out. 
And two days later from the living room on the radiator all off.

These issues with the host and tried to contact but the answers did not give.
At the same time several electrical appliances(heater, hair dryer), writing so that the answer was. 
Who heater, turn off the house lights all turn off the Hairdryer to write??

Too angry or we host continue to follow and tried to contact him. 
Eventually the host electric providers to fire, but was check-out day called....

And the electric company have to tell, 
This house is already Electric to several at the same time not so customized off state.

I host on never not heard a word. 
Continue electricity at the same time several Don't write and only said.

Of course the host entry in if you think about it so that I can believe.

다른후기처럼 위치가 좋더군요.걸어서 5분에서 10분거리에 여러 메트로가 있고 주변에 상가가 많아 편리해요..지내다 욕조가 막히는 배수문제가 있었는데 연락하자마자 바로 해결해주더군요~.세탁기 드라이기가 있어 긴여행에 자주 세탁할수있어 편했어요.다만 문마다 잠김장치가없고 엘리베이터가 없는건물이라 짐을 들고 내릴때 남자들조차 힘에 부쳐하니 여자들끼리 이용한다면 문제가 될것같아요.그리고 숙소가 추워요ㅠㅠ가을겨울에 이용할거면 전기담요같은게 필요할듯하네요,1,breton,ko-en,"Other reviews like the location is good.5 minutes walk to 10 minutes from several metro and around the box more convenient...... the tub is a clogged drain problem, there was contact as soon as solved a major~.The washer dryer has a long journey on often Laundry will be easy.Just the door lock device is not and does not have an Elevator the building is Jim holding my when men, even in the bags. women feel to be a problem like it.And stay cold. ㅠㅠ fall in the winter or if the electric blanket such as you need."
"非常好的居住体验,Morgan是一个装修设计师,他把自己的一个小公寓装修得非常完美,处处体现了对生活质量的追求和空间的完美利用,漂亮而实用的公寓,虽然面积不大,但是用中国的一句老话能很好的形容:麻雀虽小五脏俱全｡入住的床铺非常舒服柔软,一切用品十分干净｡离地铁站很近,交通便利,附近有小超市可以买东西在公寓里自己做来吃｡Morgan是个非常友好而健谈的人,虽然在巴黎碰到的很多法国人并不友善,导致对法国的旅行印象不佳,但是在Morgan这里居住的时光,绝对是在法国旅行期间一段很棒的体验,推荐独自旅行的人入住这个完美的公寓,认识这位完美的房东",1,breton,zh-en,"Very good live experience,Morgan is a decorator,he put himself in a small apartment renovated perfectly,everywhere reflects the quality of life the pursuit of and the space of perfect use,pretty and practical apartment,although small in size,but with the Chinese old saying Can Be Well Described:small but perfectly formed apartment. Check the bed is very comfortable and soft,and all supplies very clean apartment. From the subway station very near,traffic is convenient,close to a small supermarket you can buy things in the apartment do it yourself to eat well. Morgan is a very friendly and talkative person,and while in Paris met many French people are not friendly,cause of the France travel impression poor,but at the Morgan here live time,is definitely travelling in France during a period of great experience,recommended for traveling alone people stay in this perfect apartment,the perfect landlord"

"지난 추석연휴 기간동안 Greg의 아파트를 이용하였습니다. 총 3명인 저희 가족이 5박을 하는 동안 부족함이 없는 아파트였습니다. 아파트의 위치, 청결도, 그리고 특히, 호스트인 Greg의 친절하고 정확한 안내 및 여러가지 배려 등은 저희 가족의 여행을 더욱 풍요롭게 해 주었습니다! Greg의 아파트를 고려할 경우, 참고해야 할 점을 몇가지 말한다면, 우선 유럽기준 2층, 그외 지역 기준으로 3층에 위치해 있기 때문에 체크인 또는 체크아웃 할 때 짐이 많으면 조금 힘들 수가 있다는 점(다른 오래된 아파트들도 마찬가지이지만), 또한 생각보다 공간이 조금 작아서 아이 포함 3가족이 지내기에는 적당하지만 성인 3명 이상인 경우에는 조금 불편할 수도 있을 것 같다는 점, 이 정도 외에는 더할 나위없이 좋았습니다! 
마지막으로 가장 훌륭한 것은 Host인 Greg의 정말 친절하고 훌륭한 안내 및 배려 였습니다! 만약에 이 숙소를 예약하신다면 Greg의 친절함에 감동하실 겁니다!",1,breton,ko-en,"Last Chuseok holidays during Greg's apartment.

"숙소가 작지만 정말 깨끗하고 소파베드지만 자는 데 전혀 불편함이 없었어요!
다만 3층에 숙소가 있는데 나선형 계단이 좁고 가팔라서 제 캐리어를 Gwenaelle이 같이 들어줬는데 넘 무거운 짐 있으신 분은 고려하셔야 할 거 같아요
치안도 좋은 거 같아요 밤 열두시반쯤 버스정류장에서 걸어오는데 갤러리 같은 곳이 닫더라도 불이 켜져있고 카페나 바 같은데도 사람이 있어서 그리고 숙소 바로 앞 크레페 가게도 열어서 많이 무섭지 않았네요
겨울인데 라디에이터에 온풍기까지 있어서 하나도 안 추웠고 다만 윗집이나 주변이 좀 시끄럽긴 했는데 피곤해서 별로 신경이 쓰이진 않았어요",1,breton,ko-en,"The hostel is small but really clean and the sofa bed, but having no discomfort at all.
Just on the 3rd floor of the hostel there is a spiral staircase, narrow and steeper, in the carrier Gwenaelle this, like he did over the heavy load you are considering, you should do the same.
Policing is also a night, all based around a bus stop in The Walking gallery is closed, even with the lights on and the cafe or bar such person from and a choice of front crepe shop is also open in a lot of not scary.

"地处巴黎最精华的地段,出门往左就是歌剧院大街,往右是利沃里大街｡沿着后者依次排开的是:卢浮宫､杜伊勒丽花园及协和广场｡从家门口到万多姆广场的走路时间为5分钟,到歌剧院为8分钟,到老佛爷百货为15分钟,到橘园美术馆15分钟,到左岸的奥赛博物馆20分钟｡周边日餐厅法餐厅极多,面包房超市一应俱全｡
房屋交由专业房屋租赁公司管理,客户经理的专业素质好｡房东也非常好,与她沟通非常高效､顺畅｡
你看到的图片就是真实的房屋状况,干净､宽敞､舒适｡
我们一家三口在此地停留了三晚,最后一天回国因为是很晚的航班,恰巧当天没有后续房客入住,因此直到晚上七点半我们才check out｡
总之非常推荐这家｡门口杜伊勒丽花园里的摩天轮体验绝对会让你看到不一样的巴黎!",1,breton,zh-en,"In Paris the best of the lot,out to the left is the Opera House the street,to the right is the Warwick Avenue area. Along the latter in turn arranged to:the Louvre, and Dewey Le beautiful gardens and the Place de La Concorde area. From the doorstep to the thousand star hotel walking time is 5 minutes,to the Opera House is 8 minutes to the Galeries Lafayette Department store is 15 minutes,to the Eiffel Tower 15 minutes,to the Left Bank of the Orsay Museum and 20 minutes home. Surrounding day dining restaurant French restaurant very much,bakery, supermarket are all available as well.
House by a professional home rental company manage,customer managers and professional qualities of a good home. The landlord is also very good,communication with her was very efficient, and smooth areas.
The pictures you see is the real condition of the dwelling,clean, and spacious, and comfortable apartment.
We are a family of three in this to stay a third night,the last day of the return home because it is very late flight,it so happens that on the day there is no subsequent tenant check-in,so until the evening seven o'clock half of us only check out area.
In conclusion very recommended this area. The door du Ille beautiful garden Ferris wheel experience will definitely make you see a different Paris!"
"리용역에 밤 11시쯤 도착하여 늦은 시간에 에어비앤비에 도착했어요. 늦은 시간에도 불구하고 helene은 우리가 지낼 곳에 대해 친절히 설명해주었어요. 여행 준비 과정에서 궁금한 점에도 빠르게 답변해주었고 도착 날 건물 비밀번호를 다시 한번 알려주는 세심함도 좋았어요.

다른 후기에서도 볼 수 있듯 6층까지 계단으로 올라가야 하지만 크게 힘들진 않았어요. 또한 집이 예쁘고 아늑하며 제게 있어 가장 중요한 청결함까지 만족스러웠어요. :)

그리고 파리는 집 위치가 중요하죠. 많은 사람들이 기대하는 에펠탑이 보이는 위치는 아니지만 10호선, 7호선 환승역으로 관광 명소로 이동하는데 편리했고 한국인들이 많이 찾는 몽쥬약국은 걸어서 10분이에요! 까르푸 익스프레스는 집 바로 아래에 있어 간단한 것을 살 수 있고 대형 까르푸는 걸어서 15분 정도에 있어요. 

참고로 집 전체를 렌탈하는 것이 아닌 호스트와 공유하는 에어비앤비 랍니다.

파리 가신다면 이 곳에 머무르는 것을 추천해드립니다. 좋은 여행 하세요

Merci, Helene :)",1,breton,ko-en,"Lyon station at 11 o'clock at night arrived in the late hours of Airbnb arrived. Despite the late time helene we are looking for a friendly description. Ready to travel in the course of questions and quick answers has arrived the day building the password once again tell the attention to detail was also great.

After the other in as you can see, the 6th floor up by stairs to climb, but significantly wasn't difficult. Also the house is pretty and cozy and most important clean up is very satisfactory. :)

And Paris House, location is important. Many people expect that the Eiffel Tower looks, but not the 10 line, 7 line interchange station with the tourist attractions which was convenient and many people find Mont-pharmacy is within 10 minutes! Carrefour Express is set just below the simple things you can buy and a large Carrefour within 15 minutes. 

Note that the whole house rental is not the host that is shared with Airbnb grows.

Paris you're staying! A good travel.

There are three separate bedrooms,one master bedroom(double bed),a second bedroom(single bed),there is also a study room with bed(double bed);the two greatly large living room,Windows forget to get out from a particularly good night.
