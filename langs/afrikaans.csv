"Dit apartement ligt op een geweldige plek. Fijne buurt met handige en leuke winkels/ restaurants. We voelden ons veilig en thuis. Schoon gebouw en een prettig huis met veel gemakken om tot rust te komen een drukke dag in Parijs. Openbaarvervoer op minder dan 10 minuten afstand. De Sacre Coeur op ongeveer 15 minuten afstand, een geweldige plek om de dag te beginnen of af te sluiten. We're in love with Paris, thanks to Samuel! Merci! ",1,afrikaans,

"생드니 지역이 좀 위험한 지역이지만 파리는 다 위험한 지역이니 이상한 행동만 안하면 괜찮음. 지하철 역에서 숙소까지 가깝고 숙소 바로 앞에 마켓이 있어서 편함. 

호스트 줄리앙은 너무 착하고 유쾌하고 편하게 해줬고 심지어 체크인도 일찍 할 수 있더록 배려해줌. 메시지 보내면 모든 질문이 친절히 응답해줌. 

파리 다시오면 다시 이용할생각 100%임. 샤워부스가 작긴하지만 나는 키가 181에 몸무게 90인데 편하게 씻음. 고민하지 말고 이 숙소 잡으면 좋겠다. 

더 많은 후기나 질문은 인스타로 부탁해요. vakoww",1,afrikaans,
"집 넘나 예쁘고 교통 편리합니다. Bellville 역에서 도보 5분이고 빠리 어디든 쉽게 가실 수 있습니다. 주인장의 세심한 배려와 친절도 오래 기억에 남을 듯 하네요. 참고로 Belleville에 오시면 빠리의 실생활 문화 물가와 만날 수 있습니다. 관광지를 벗어난 기쁨이랄까요. 다문화 지역이라 일식 중식 동남아식 한식까지 적당히 골라 드시기도 편합니다.

"Het verblijf is erg goed bevallen. Om de hoek van de metro, supermarkt én bakker. In het appartement was Wi-Fi aanwezig. Bij aankomst lag er een kleine voorraad aan koffie, thee en broodbeleg klaar. Afwassen was niet nodig aangezien er een vaatwasser is. Verder liggen de bedden prima en ziet het verblijf er prima uit. Mochten we nog eens naar Parijs gaan, is dit een ideaal en goedkoop verblijf om nog eens te boeken!",1,afrikaans,

"It was terrible
당일날 도착했더니 방이 꽉 차서 침대가 없다고 다른주소를 주며 거기로 오라고 통보함
무려 한달 전 쯤 예약 끝냈는데도 당일날 통보
캐리어 끌고 10분 걸어갔는데 호스트의 개인 집.
여자 혼자라 무서웠고 당황스럽고 저녁 일정 망침.
집에서 이상한 냄새나고 우중충해서 기분 상하고 진짜 너무 기분 안좋았음.
그리고 다음날엔 자리있다고 숙소로 감.
여성전용 룸 예약했고, 메세지로 미리 확인까지 하고 갔는데 여성전용 룸 꽉찼다고 공용룸에 배정해줌.
예약은 아무 상관 없음 그냥 호스트 마음대로임
최대한 사람 많이 받으려고 여성전용이고 뭐고 그냥 되는대로 끼워맞춤. 초과예약도 해서 나처럼 호스트 집에서 자고온 친구 또 있었음
그리고 셋째날 또 방 옮김. 여성전용룸 자리 하나 있다고 거기로 옮기라해서 또 옮김.

절대 예약하지마세요 너무 열악하고
호스트를 신뢰할 수 없어요
예약한건 아무 소용없어요
당일날 그냥 통보식으로
주소도 바꾸고 방도 바꾸고 여성전용이고뭐고 안지켜져요
