"정말 좋은 숙소입니다. 머무는 동안 내가 파리에서 살고 있는 것 같은 느낌을 받았어요. 깨끗하고 예쁘고 고풍스러운 방입니다.
개선문을 걸어서 보러 다닐 수 있을 만큼 가깝고, 일정을 마치고 숙소로 돌아갈때 또한 개선문쪽 지하철 역을 통해서 돌아가는 것이 좋습니다, 특히 밤에는요! 그 길이 큰길이라 늦은 밤에도 사람이나 차가 꽤 있어서 안전하거든요.",1,estonian,"A really good place to stay. During the stay I lived in Paris to feel like you have received. Clean and pretty and quaint.
You can walk but be as close to the schedule, and the perfect place to return to then also improve because West subway station through the back that is a good idea, especially at night! Its length is large this late in the night people or the car is pretty in a safe."
"非常喜欢Charles的房间,是一个位于九区的私人住宅院落里~诚实的讲mini的电梯和圆弧型的楼梯间,古旧的房门都在第一时间带给了我们新鲜感~在熟悉之后,C的房子附近有很多好吃的餐厅,还有家乐福就在楼下~去每个景点或者老佛爷都很近,10mins的步行距离吧｡唯一不好的是只有一间卧室,若是六人都同时入住的话,稍显拥挤,有两张沙发床~其他都非常棒!",1,estonian,"Very like Charles room,located in the ninth area in the private residential courtyard in the~and to be honest the mini lift and the arc of the stairwell,the old door are in the first time to bring us the fresh sense~in a familiar,C. near the house there are many delicious restaurants,there's Carrefour just downstairs to go to each attraction or Galeries Lafayette are close by,10mins walking distance from the bar area. The only bad is only one bedroom,if six people are staying in,slightly cramped,with two double sofa bed to the other are very good!"

여기서 10일동안 머물렀습니다. 숙소주변은 매우 안전하고 숙소도 매우매우 깔끔했어요! 치안 매우 굿굿 마트 바로 집앞에 진짜 30초? 거리에 있어요 매우 굿. 근데 주요 관광지랑 거리가 쫌 있는데 메트로랑 버스 가까워서 괜찮앗어요. 그리고 이호스트 가족이 운영하는 레스토랑 잇는데 가격도 매우 굿이고 맛도 매우굿 마지막날 갓는데 진짜 여기 두번 올껄하고 매우 아쉬웟음 ㅠㅠ,1,estonian,"Here from 10 days in Cambodia. The hostel area is very safe and the hostel is also very very tidy! Policing is a very nice Wall set in front of a real 30 seconds? There are very good. Close to the main tourist restaurant street, we hired there with a bus close to fine seeds. And this host family-run restaurant after another but the price is also very good and taste is also very good the last day freshly it real here twice to come talk to and very very comprehensive beauty ㅠㅠ"
"이곳에 숙소를 정한것은 정말 최고의 선택이었어요. 위치도 샹젤리제와 가깝고, 집안의 모든 것들이 굉장히 앤틱스러워 아주 멋진곳이었어요.
호스트 Soline씨는 영어가 유창한 프랑스 분이셨고, 일처리가 아주 깔끔하시고 완벽했어요.
다음 파리올때도 꼭 다시 머물고싶은곳예요.
전 괜찮았지만 더위를 너무 많이 타는 분이라면 좀 더울수도 있겠지만 유럽의 여름 날씨는 선풍기만으로도 아직은 괜찮은것같아요.
너무 멋진 파리지앵의 경험이었습니다!!",1,estonian,"This is the perfect place for it is really the best choice. Location the Champs Elysees and close to the house, everything is very antique, but very cool place.
Host Soline Mr. English, fluent French, she, looks very neat and perfect.
Then in Paris I also come again to stay and I'm here.
Before I was fine but more for too much time if more you might be, but Europe's summer weather fan, but still decent.
So wonderful Parisian experience!!"

"首先房子的位置非常好,走路去卢浮宫只要8分钟左右,走路去les hall地铁站只要5分钟左右,走路到巴黎圣母院20十几分钟,离主干道有几十米,车很少所以非常安静!周围有各种商店可以买到各种你需要的东西,治安非常好｡其次房间非常好用,所有功能齐全,厨房浴室咖啡机电熨斗微波炉……,总之你日常所需的所有东西几乎都可以在这个不算太小的房间里找到,空间比你想象中大很多,布局合理,我是一个人住,我觉得即便有两个人这里也会非常宽敞,性价比超高!只是你能否订到你需要的日期,从可预定的状态看,这个公寓非常抢手,如果你想体验巴黎人的生活,而且所需日期空闲,那么就订在这里,我保证你不会失望｡Mike人很好,很及时认真地回复我的各种问题,很热爱生活｡我是第一次使用这个软件订房间并且还是在国外,因为没有信用卡没办法住酒店,但是这个公寓的体验超越大部分酒店,谢谢Mike的房间让我在这个浪漫的城市有一个难忘的回忆｡",1,estonian,"First, the location of the house is very good,walk to the Louvre as long as 8 minutes,walk to les hall subway station just 5 minutes or so,walk to the Notre Dame 20 ten minutes,away from the main road a few tens of meters,the car is very less so very quiet! Around there are various stores you can buy a variety of things you need,the security is very good as well. Secondly the room is very easy to use,all fully functional,kitchen bathroom coffee machine iron microwave......, In short you need daily of all the things almost all can be in this not too small room to find the,space than you imagine in the large lot,the layout is reasonable,I live alone,I think even if there are two people here will be very spacious,cost-effective ultra-high! Just you can order to you need to date,from the predetermined state to see,this apartment is very sought-after,if you want to experience Parisian life,and the desired date is free,then book here,I guarantee you will not be disappointed as well.

10일동안 묵었는데 구조가 독특하고 예쁘긴했지만 매우 좁고 세명이 연속으로 씻으니까 나중엔 뜨거운물이 멈췄어요 그리고 술먹고 욕실올라가지 마세요 골로갈수도 있어요 물도잘빠지고 좋았지만 세면대가 너무멀어서 세수할때 정말 힘듭니다 아저씨가 친절했지만 휴지는 더안주시더라구요 ㅠ 벌레같은건 없었고 침대가 2인용이라 2인실로쓰기에 적합할 듯 하네요 전반적으로 나쁘진않았으나 불편한점도 없진않네요 나름좋아요!,1,estonian,"10 days was structure is unique and pretty but very narrow and three consecutive wash. later hot water stopped and get drunk and the bathroom out don't gold go to have water .. my dad and was good but the washbasin is too normal in the world when really hard..... uncle was kind, but the rest more during the week if I worm and I had no bed for 2 persons; 2 rooms with writing on the appropriate House. overall not bad, but uncomfortable point no not I I I!"
전체적으로 굉장히 좋은 아늑한 숙소였습니다. 아기자기하게 잘 꾸며놓은 실내에 난방도 따뜻하게 잘 되었구요. 지하철도 굉장히 가까워서 이동하는데에는 큰 문제가 없었습니다. 다만 동네가 18지구 근처고 이민자들이 많은 곳이다보니 조금 위험하다고 느낄 때가 있었습니다. 대신 그래서인지 저렴한 마트가 주변에 매우 많았어요. 전체적으로 만족합니다!,1,estonian,"Overall, very nice and cozy hostel. Beautiful and well appointed-indoor heating also warm as well. The subway is also very close to a move to a big problem. Just the neighborhood of 18 near-Earth and immigrants and more than a little dangerous when you feel. Instead, it's cheap Mart around very much. Totally worth the money!"
"에어비앤비 처음 이용하는 거라 걱정도 많았는데 다행히 좋은 호스트를 만나 순조롭게 지낼 수 있었습니다. 전반적으로 호스트에 대한 만족도가 높았고—너무 부담스럽지 않으면서 답변이 빠르고 친절했습니다. 숙소 컨디션도 전반적으로 무난했고, 무엇보다 위치가 가장 맘에 들었습니다. 대부분 관광명소를 걸어서, 혹은 대중교통으로 가능했고 또 동네 분위기도 안전하고 맘에 들었습니다. 추천합니다!",1,estonian,"Airbnb first that worried many was fortunately a good host to meet smoothly can. Overall, the hosts have not—too undemanding to do if the answer is quick and friendly. Visit also great, location is the most just. Most attractions on foot, or by public transport was possible and also Neighbourhood Safety and access. Recommended!"

숙소의 위치가 아주 좋았습니다. 우선 역과 가까웠으며 주택가라 조용하고 치안이 좋았습니다. 다른 나라로 이동시 리옹역으로 버스가 한번에 가서 이동이 편했어요! 또한 근처에 마트가 하나 있어서 뭘 사기도 좋았어요. 다만 1층이라 조금 습해서 냄새가 난다는 문제점이 있었습니다. 그렇지만 그걸 다 커버할만큼 호스트가 친절했고 위치나 준비해준 물건들이 좋았습니다.,1,estonian,"Location of the hostel is very good. First station was close and the homes are quiet and security was good. Other countries go to Lyon area as a bus in one go and easy to navigate. Also near Mart one what a good.

"위치는 에펠탑에서 걸어서 5분거리, 개선문에서 15분 정도의 거리라서 매우 마음에 들었습니다. 
  저희가 체크인하는 과정에서 문제가 생겨 난감했었는데 호스트가 신속하게 대처를 해주어 좋았습니다.
  그리고 세탁기, 다리미, 드라이기 등 편의용품이 잘 구비되어있는편이라 좋았습니다.
  아쉬운 점은 더블베드의 침구에서 좋지않은 냄새가 났고, 4명정도의 인원을 수용하기에는 공간이 비좁은 편이었습니다. 
  그렇지만 가격대비 훌륭한 숙소라고 생각합니다!",1,estonian,"The location of the Eiffel Tower in 5 minutes walk distance, improvement in 15 minutes in a very. 
Our check-in process in the problem was developed the host to respond quickly to very good.
And washing machine, iron, dryer, etc amenities provided are also good.

깔끔하고 좋았어요. 근데 방이 아니라 거실이에요. 그래서 문은 따로 없고 뚫려있어요. 크게 신경쓰지 않은 부분이지만 화장실도 문을 잠글수 없었어요. 교통편이 아주 좋아요. 주변에 술집이나 가게들이 많이 있어요. 그 대신 밤에 조금 시끄러워요. 호스트는 게스트에게 간섭을 하지 않는 편이기 때문에 혼자 조용히 여행하시는 분들에게는 좋아요. 게인 저그로는 별! 로여써요ㅜ,1,estonian,"Tidy and was great. Of the room and not the living room. So the door the pocked. Significantly don't care part, but the bathroom lock the door. Transportation is very good. Around the pub or shop.

역과 가깝구요 근처에 조그만 마트도 있습니다. 처음 집을 찾을땐 조금 헤맸어요. 핸드폰이 느려서 보내주신 동영상을 뒤늦게보고 찾아갈 수 있었습니다ㅎㅎ 집은 정말 깨끗하고 좋았어요. 인테리어도 너무 예뻤구요. 다만 씻을때 뜨거운물이 어느정도 나오다가 끊겨버리더라구요. 그래서 하루씩 번갈아가며 한사람은 찬물로 샤워를 했습니다ㅎㅎㅎ 그래도 집은 너무 마음에 들었어요. 추천합니다!,1,estonian,The'. near on the Mart. The first house to find my little handy. Phone slow to send in your videos to belatedly report the find. ㅎㅎ House is really clean and it was great. The interior is also so pretty. Just wash and then hot water to some extent I was cut off .. So day one the man is a cold shower. ㅎㅎㅎ so the house too. Recommended!

집이 넓고 방도 광장히 편했어요. 집주인을 만날 시간이 별로 없어서 아쉽기도 했지만 자기 집인듯 편하게 지내고 싶으신 분이라면 만족할 만한 숙소에요. 위치는 북역에서 걸어서 15분 정도이고 또 더 가까운 역들이 몇 개 있는데 여자가 혼자 여행을 다니기엔 조금 무서운 동네였어요. 그래도 파리 중심과 가깝고 북역이 있어서 교통편이 편하다는 점에서 좋은 숙소였어요!,1,estonian,The house is spacious and light and more relaxed. Meet the landlord don't have much time in but his house as comfortable and as if you have a satisfactory stay. The hotel is located a 15-minute walk from degree and also closer to the station some have a woman to travel alone next to a little scary the neighborhood. So the heart of Paris and close to the North Station transportation is convenient in that it is a good check!

숙소근처에 가까운 지하철역이 3개나있어서 이동하기 너무 편리했어요. 숙소사진으로 보았을때는 에펠탑이 숙소에서 작게 보일줄알았는데 생각보다 크게 보여서 너무 좋았습니다. 근데 숙소에 체크인시간보다 일찍 입실한것도 아닌데 다 마르지않은 수건이 접어져있어 냄새가 조금나고 사용할수없는 상태라 개인적으로 챙겨갔던 수건을 사용했어요. 이점은 참고하시면 좋으실듯합니다! 그외에는 너무 편한 숙소로 에펠뷰숙소를 찾으신다면 추천해드리고싶어요.,1,estonian,"Accommodation near close to Metro Station 3 or the moving too. Stay with as I watched the Eiffel Tower hostel in look KL I think larger than the show so far, so good. Near the hostel check in time earlier than entering a room it is not do not a towel, fold get the smell a little and use no state individually Packed was a towel. Advantages and see the good......!

Around the Michelin one-star restaurants, and several good restaurants are. Fruity cheese Mart in the near Mans square corner and all the tourist attractions and the accessibility was so nice.

Severine은 매우 친절했습니다! 집도 조금 작긴했지만 사진과 같았구 저흰 여성 두명이서 생활했는데 크게 불편한 점은 없었어요. 지하철도 바로근처라 교통도 매우 편리했구요. 조금 아쉬웠던 점은 샤워실이 매우 좁았다는 것과 마트가 좀 멀리있단것 외에는 다 괜찮았습니다~,1,estonian,"Severine is very kind. The house is also a bit small but as shown in the photo did we women two in life was me feel very welcome. The subway is also right near the traffic is also very convenient.

"이 곳에서 삼일간 지냈습니다. 공항에서 숙소까지 지하철로 한시간정도 걸려서 멀다고 생각했는데 막상 도착하고나니, 집이 너무 마음에 들었습니다 ! 또 호스트께서 지도에 직접 맛집을 표시해 놓은것을 보고 감동받았습니다. 파리 중심가까지 가려면 40분정도가 걸리지만 일정이 끝나고 돌아오는 발걸음은 굉장히 가벼웠습니다. 이 곳은 아늑하고, 따뜻하고, 편안했습니다. 다음에도 파리에 온다면 한 번 더 묵고 싶습니다 ",1,estonian,"This place in three days time. The hostel from the airport up to one hour subway takes away from Thought film arrives and the house, too !

"Alexandre의 숙소는 굉장히 만족스러웠습니다. 먼저 위치가 굉장히 좋습니다. 걸어서 루브르에 10분이면 도착하고 노틀담 성당 등도 15분 정도면 걸어서 도착했던 것 같구요. RER역에서도 걸어서 15분 이내의 거리라 샤를드골 공항에서 오기도 편합니다.

번화가에 위치해있어서 밤12시까지고 사람들이 밖에 나와 술 마시고 하는 분위기고 치안도 좋습니다.

숙소는 아주 넓지는 않고 조그만 거실과 침실 하나가 있는 깔끔하고 아늑한 분위기입니다. 3층?인데 엘레베이터가 없었지만 크게 불편하지는 않았습니다.

다시 파리에 가면 또 여기서 묵고 싶습니다.",1,estonian,"Alexandre's place is very satisfying. First the location is very good. Walk to the Louvre in 10 minutes and the Notre Dame Cathedral is also 15 minutes walk from had arrived. RER station walk from 15 minute as Charles de Gaulle airport coming from the room....

Place in until 12 at night and people go out and drink and atmosphere and policing.

The hostel is very wide, not only living room and bedroom one has a neat and cozy atmosphere. The 3rd floor?But the Elevator there was no but to the.

Go back to Paris or stay here."

"位置非常好!走路去拉法葉7分鐘,羅浮宮跟瑪德蓮區都只要15分鐘,附近很多地鐵站,巷口斜對面的餐廳好吃又不貴!家中環境很大,一個大客廳跟兩間房間,但小的房間建議可以多個衣櫃(本來的衣櫃被house keeper放東西,沒辦法用)這樣才能晾浴巾等衣物｡
    馬桶跟浴室分開,浴室很大,但淋浴的熱水不夠四個人連續洗,第一天晚上有兩個人洗冷水澡,詢問屋主才說洗三個人要等一小時才會有熱水.....但之後幾天有等一小時,水還是不夠熱,冬天需要嚴加注意｡廚房有烤麵包機跟熱水壺和洗碗機,如果家中任何電器有異常或破損請立刻跟屋主反應,以免有後續糾紛｡以價格跟地理位置和房間大小,這間很值得推薦!!",1,estonian,"Location is very good! Walk to Lafayette 7 minutes,the Louvre with the Madeleine district are just 15 minutes,near many subway station,alley diagonally opposite the restaurant is delicious and not expensive! The home environment is very large,a large living room with two rooms,but small rooms suggestions can be multiple wardrobe(originally the wardrobe was house keeper to put things,no way)so as to clothes towels and other Laundry areas.
The toilet with the bathroom separate,the bathroom was large,but shower hot water is not enough four successive washes,the first night there were two people wash a cold shower,ask the owner before said Wash three to one hour will have hot water..... But after a few days with like an hour,water is still not hot enough,the Winter need to strictly pay attention as well. The kitchen has a toaster with an electric kettle and a dishwasher,if the home of any electrical appliances there are abnormal or damaged, immediately tell the house the main reaction,in order to avoid subsequent disputes as well.

Around and many museums in the long view, even convenient, to eat, and many did. Almost a wash, but let you know to use the apartment for a long stay never more than a breath. The room and the 4 of use just good.
The bathroom door, closet door, door and as the broken parts were, but overall a great bunch. Then in Paris in or want to use."
elle est genial et amité.  bonne hôtesse,1,estonian,she is awesome and amité. good hostess
숙소 위치나 청결도 어느 하나 나쁠 것 없이 상쾌하고 햇빛도 잘 드는 방이라 아주 만족했습니다. 욕실도 깨끗합니다. 하나 결점이 있다면 4층에 위치하며 엘레베이터가 없어서 계단을 올라가야 한다는 점 정도 있습니다. 주변은 차이나타운이 있어 비교적 동양인이 많습니다. 또 주변에 있는 일식집은 중국인이 하지만 영어도 잘하고 교자가 맛있습니다!,1,estonian,"Location, clean and which one is bad without refreshing and the sunshine even better way very satisfied. Bathroom also clean. One drawback if you are on the 4th floor located with Elevator, no stairs to climb to that degree. Around Chinatown are relatively the same shape. Or around some Chinese, but English is also good and the gyoza is delicious!"
"很美的坊間很舒適的床,Renaud還貼心提供許多很新的旅遊手冊,地點非常的方便,離火車站真的非常近,也很好找｡公寓有電梯,因此行李的搬運也不是問題!",1,estonian,"Beautiful printing and very comfortable bed,Renaud also many facilities provide many new travel manual,the location is very convenient,from the train station is really very close,also very good looking as well. The apartment has an Elevator,so Luggage handling is not a problem!"
"Renaud 的房子地址位置很好,距里昂车站走路3min,很方便出行｡周围有很多营业到很晚的餐厅｡
房间很大,整洁,床非常舒服!!躺下不想起来｡
房主人超级好,很耐心等我们入住,沟通很及时,还给我们推荐了很多餐厅｡他是个很有创造力的艺术家吧,有出售自己的作品｡
这次行程很赶,没有更多的聊天,如果有机会回到巴黎,会考虑再入住的!

推荐给出门的情侣或者朋友!",1,estonian,"Renaud House address of location good,away from Gare de Lyon walk 3min,very convenient to travel well. Around a lot of business to very late in the restaurant area.
The room was large,clean,bed very comfortable!! Lie down and don't want to get up as well.
A homeowner who is super nice,very patient and so we stay,communication was timely,back to the we recommend a lot of restaurants and great views. He is a very creative artist,have sold their work area.
This trip was very Rush,no more chat,if the opportunity to return to Paris,consider a re-live!

Recommended to go out for a couple or friends!"
Best time ever!,1,estonian,Best time ever!
"位置很好｡就在卢浮宫附近｡步行大约10多分钟｡不过整栋楼只有三楼有厕所,每次要上厕所得跑上跑下｡还有木板有很大的声音｡晚上如果家人先睡,跑上跑下会有很大噪音｡距离三号线地铁只有1min｡附近有一堆地道的日餐和韩餐馆｡",1,estonian,"The location is very good as well. It is in the Louvre near the House. Walk about 10 more minutes home. But the whole building only the third floor has toilet,every time you want to on the toilet have to run up and down the room. There is also the boardwalk has a great sound, and great views. In the evening if the family to sleep,running up and down there will be a lot of noise as well. From the third subway line is only 1min area. Nearby there is a bunch of authentic Japanese and Korean restaurants in the area."
"Varaus sujui joutuisasti ja luotettavasti. Asunto vastasi kuvausta ja paikka oli mukava. Vaikka asunto sijaitsi ravintolakadulla, oli asunto rauhallinen. Varustetaso oli hyvä ja siisti.
Kannattaa kuitenkin huomioida, että metrolta asuntoon oli 400m portaita ylöspäin eli ei heikkojalkaisille.",1,estonian,"The booking came quickly and reliably. The apartment matched the description and the place was nice. Although the apartment is a restaurant on the street, was the apartment quiet. The level of equipment was good and clean. 
Consider, however, that from the subway to the apartment was 400m up the ladder so no weak legs for daddy."
"숙소 위치가 정말 좋아요. 루브르도 가깝고 주변에 버스정류장, 지하철도 많고 쇼핑센터도 있어요. 바로 앞에는 음식점 옆에는 마트 주위에 한인마트 코인세탁소 모두 걸어서 갈 수 있는 거리에 있어요! 방 크기는 충분했고 깔끔하고 히터도 따뜻하고 좋았어요. 다만 방음이 잘 안돼서 윗집이 맨날 파티하고 떠드는 바람에 좀 시끄럽기도 하고 세면대가 너무 작아 세면 용도는 아닌 것 같고 딱 손 씻을 정도 크기? 여서 별 4개를 주었으나 집은 진~~~짜 좋았어요!",1,estonian,"Hostel location is really good. The Louvre is also close to the bus station, subway and shopping center. Right in front of the food store next to the Mart around the point for coin laundries, all within walking distance! Room size was sufficient and clean, and the heater is also warm and was great. Just how well the newbie top collection of the top Day party and left in the wind a little noisy and the sink is too small the purpose is and just hand wash the size? From 4 stars to was the house is true~~~squeeze was great!"
"急なお願いやﾄﾗﾌﾞﾙにも優しく対処してくれました｡家ももちろん綺麗で過ごしやすく､Benjamin夫婦の人柄もとても良かったです｡
駅近でどこへ行くにも地下鉄で便利でした｡ﾊﾟﾘに来る時はまた利用したいです｡本当にありがとうございました!",1,estonian,"Steep please and cant live shooter Edition gives the full experience to gently deal with it in it. The house is of course clean and comfortable well Benjamin the personality of the couple was also very good in a can.
Located near a train station so access to Metro is convenient and fun! Pattern I downloaded to come when it was working. Thank you very much for your kind response!"
Mohamed est tres aimable.,1,estonian,Mohamed is very kind.
루브르 박물관과 가까워서 넘 편했어요. 밤에 산책가기도 넘 좋구요~ 현대건축이나 현대미술 좋아하시면 주변에 있는 퐁피듀센터 강추합니다. 사진보다 집이 더 넓었어요. 욕실도 2개라 편했구요. 택시만 타고 다녔지만 바로 앞에 버스정류장도 있도 근처에 지하철역도 있어 편할거같아요~ 다만 오래된 건물이다 보니 계단에선 오래된 나무 냄새가 좀 나요~ 집 내부에선 전혀 안나구요!,1,estonian,"The Louvre Museum and close to more comfortable. Walking at night is also a good idea. modern architecture or modern art like you around Pont Philadelphia Education Center. Photos than the house more spacious. Bathroom 2 online. Taxi, but the ride went but at you also near a subway station, guests can also be like~ just an old building. the stairs in the old wooden smell.~ inside the house at all Anna!"
"집이 매우 깨끗하고 좋았습니다. 위치는 치안이 매우 좋은 위치고 근처에 마트가 매우 많고, 지하철역도 매우 가까워서 관광지 돌아다니기 매우 편했습니다. 에펠탑과 가까운 거리여서 밤에 심심할때마다 나가서 화이트 에펠탑을 보실수 있습니다. 침대도 2층 2인침대와 2인 소파베드가 있는데 매우 깨끗하고 넓고 좋았습니다. 호스트분도 매우 친절하시고 영어를 잘하셔서 의사소통에 문제가 전혀 없었습니다. 다르미안 형 사랑해요!",1,estonian,"The house is very clean and good. Location, security, very good location and near the gate is very large, and the subway station is also very close to tour around it is very comfortable.

모든 장소 청소가 잘 되어있고 침구도 전부 세탁하여 바꿔주시는거 눈으로 확인했습니다. 수건도 충분했구요. 침대하나가 소파베드라 걱정했는데 매트리스가 생각보다 편해서 편안하게 잘 잤습니다. 주변에 슈퍼도 두개나 있고 무엇보다 조용해서 좋았어요. 밤비행기탄다고 짐도 맡아주셔서 마지막날까지 편안하게 잘 놀다 가네요. 집은 오래되었지만 파리 숙소어딜가도 다 그렇더라고요. 호스트도 친절하십니다. 가성비 최고의 숙소! 추천합니다,1,estonian,"All cleaning is done and bedding from Laundry to replace or check by eye. A towel is sufficient. Bed or sofa bed as I was worried the mattress think more comfortable comfortable and slept well. Around Super Or and What than using. Night flight to Istanbul, and Jim also officiated at the last day to play well. The house is old but Paris stay, even the treadmill is also so. The host is also friendly. With the best of facilities! Recommended."

여자혼자 남자둘의집에 묵는것이 쉬운 결정은 아니었는데 결론적으로 매우 만족스러웠습니다. 위치도 좋고 깨끗하며 조용합니다. 거실이없는 복도끝방을 쓰기때문에 기숙사방같은 느낌이 듭니다. 저는 젠틀한 호스트와 대화하고 정보를 얻는것이 참 좋았는데 원치않으시면 숙소만 조용히 쓸 수도 있습니다. 주변 레스토랑을 추천받을수 있다는 것과 부엌을 쓸수있다는 것 또한 큰 장점입니다. 강추!,1,estonian,"Women men leave the house in silence it was not an easy decision but in conclusion I was very satisfied. Good location and clean and quiet. Living room without corridor terminal room writing because of Dorm bag-like feeling. My gentle hosts and to get information this good, I don't want to stay, but quietly write. Around the restaurant to get featured there and that the kitchen use is also a big advantage. Hot!"
"교통도 좋고 에펠탑도 숙소 가까운 자리에 위치해있어 너무 좋았습니다.
집 안에 식기, 수건, 드라이기 등 생활 용품이 구비되어 있으며 위생상태도 청결했습니다.
다만, 뜨거운 물이 정해진 양만큼만 나오고 그 뒤는 몇 시간을 기다려야 다시 뜨거운 물이 나오는 방식이여서 물을 매우 아껴써야했습니다.
집 히터도 틀어놓으면 매우 따뜻했고 침대도 편하고 이불도 두꺼워서 너무 좋았어요!
고마워요 에릭",1,estonian,"Transportation is also good and the Eiffel Tower stay close in location to you.
Inside the House, this life supplies are also available sanitary condition.
However, the hot water amount only followed by a few hours to wait again for hot water how to water very sparingly by you.
The house heater is also wrong-if it was very warm and beds comfortable and the duvet too thick so good!

첫날 비행기가 두개 다 지연이 되어서 예상시간보다 훨씬 늦은 새벽에 도착했는데도 불구하고 친절하게 숙소를 설명해주고 가셔서 너무 감사했어요 ! 숙소는 정말 예뻐서 같이 간 친구들 모두 만족했고 부엌과 화장실 모두 사용하면서 불편함이 없을 만큼 모든게 잘 갖춰져 있는 숙소입니다. 관광지와도 가까워서 이동이 편하고 4층이라 캐리어를 들고 올라갈 때 약간 힘든 것 만 빼면 정말 완벽하고 멋진 숙소에요,1,estonian,"The first day the plane is both a delay in the expected time than much late Dawn landed in the kindly accommodations, description and Neteller so grateful.

Attractions close to this hotel and 4th Floor get when slightly tough but really a perfect and wonderful stay."

슬리퍼 꼭 챙기세요!!",1,estonian,"The location is very good.The Louvre,the Marais district,the Pompidou near until you can walk and the rer station is also close.

사랑스러운 미소의 Elise. 집은 매우 깨끗하고 모든 것이 갖춰져 있습니다. Elise는 늘 친절하게 대해주었고 불편함 없이 지냈습니다. 저는 숙소가 관광 지역이나 파리 중심가와 좀 멀었고 호스트 언니가 거실에서 주무시는 것이 살짝 신경 쓰였지만 그보다 조용하고 깨끗한 숙소를 원하시면 문제 되지 않을 것 같습니다.,1,estonian,"Lovely smile of the Elise. The house is very clean and equipped with everything. Elise has always were very friendly and helpful and the lobby! I stay in the tourism area or center of Paris, and some were far, and the host sister is in the living room too would be slightly nervous, but than him a quiet and clean place to stay if you want the problem would not be the same."
와이파이가 없고 조금 춥다는 것 이외에는 완벽한 숙소. 안전하고 개인 욕실이며 엘리베이터 있고 취사가 가능하고 조리 기구 있음. 그리고 역에서 나와 1분도 안걸리는 위치에 있고 숙소에서 5분이면 마트와 한인마트 전부 갈 수 있음. 질문에 대한 호스트의 응답도 빠른 편. 이제까지 다녀본 에어비앤비 중 가장 좋았던 곳. 다시 파리를 와도 묵고 싶은 곳!,1,estonian,"Wi-Fi and a little cold. other than that perfect stay. A safe and a private bathroom and the Elevator and catering, and cooking utensils. And from the station and 1 especially those located in the hostel in 5 minutes and point for the whole can go. For the question of the host response is also fast. Ever the Airbnb one of the most good place. Back to Paris and stay where you want!"
"체크인 시간이 늦어서, 아침 일찍 도착하면 좀 불편해요. 화장실이랑 샤워실 청결에 예민하시면 머무는동안 신경쓰일 수 있어요. 화장실 볼 때마다 되게 착잡했거든요. 근데 엄청 꼼꼼하게 보는 것 아니면 지내기에 좋아요. 아! 침대가 엄청엄청 불편해요. 그래도 에펠탑이 바로 보여서 그게 제일 큰 장점이에요. 화이트에펠까지 안나가고 볼 수 있어서 좋아요.",1,estonian,"Check-in time is late, early in the morning when you arrive a little uncomfortable. The rooms clean for people to stay during the care day. The toilet whenever you look to be mixed. But a huge, meticulously look is not the best. Ah! The bed is awful awful uncomfortable.

"오분정도 거리에 에펠탑을 바로 아래에서 볼 수 있다는 것이 너무 낭만적이었습니다. 많은 아파트들이 있는 거주 지역인 것도 좋았으며, 주변에 슈퍼마켓도 있어서 좋았습니다. 샹젤리제 거리 등 주요 관광지도 버스로 쉽게 이동 할 수 있어 편리 했습니다. 다만 침구에서 좀 냄새가 났는데 세탁이 깨끗이 되어있지않은 것 같습니다. 하지만 다시 파리에 방문해도 이 숙소에 머물고 싶어요 !",1,estonian,"Five minutes away from the Eiffel Tower to the right viewed from below, that is so romantic. Many apartments have a living area that was also good, and around a supermarket. The Champs-Elysees and other major tourist attractions by bus to be able to move easily handy.

"너무 좋은 위치. pigalle역 1분 거리라서 지하철 타기 너무 편리했고 버스정류장도 코앞이라 여기저기 다니기 너무 좋았어요.

집 들어가자마자 너무 예뻐서 감탄했어요. 집주인이 감각 있는 사람인 것 같아요. 사소한 조명이나 테이블까지 느낌있어서 밤에 와인 마시기 너무 좋았어요. 티비도 엄청 큰데 저는 티비를 안봐서..
욕조도 있고 뜨건 물 잘나오고 굿굿 
주방도 괜찮고 거실/주방/침실/욕실이 다 분리되어있는 이런 집에서 이가격에 묵을 수 있다니 정말 대박이라고 생각합니당....
다음에 파리 가도 여기 묵고 싶어요!",1,estonian,"Too good location. pigalle Station 1 minute walk from subway rides too was convenient and the bus stop is also around the corner, here is good too.

Home for so pretty from admiration. The landlord sense of the person you are I guess. Minor lighting or table until the feeling in a night on wine drinking was good too. TV is also huge but I have TV to watch.
Tub and hot water, well and good. 
The kitchen is fine and the living room/kitchen/bedroom/bathroom below which separates this house from this price were really for and all free.....
Then in Paris, go here want to stay!"

집 안정성 좋고 깨끗하고 편리했어요. 중심지에서 살짝 떨어져있긴 했지만 지하철로 다니기 충분했고 역에서는 살짝 걸어야해서 너무 늦게 다니면 조금 무섭긴 했어요. 잘 때는 조용해서 너무 좋았는데 해지고 다니기엔 너무 조용해서 살짝 무서운 느낌? 그래도 다른 파리 지역보다는 치안 굉장히 좋은 느낌이었어요. 집 내부 깔끔하고 아담하고 와이파이 잘 터졌고. 호스트 빠른 응답해줘서 친절하고 좋았어요. 다시 묵을 의사 있어요!,1,estonian,"House stability is good and clean and convenient. In the center from slightly off, but the subway had had enough and in lightly walk too late if a little scary-looking. Well when quiet is too good and is too quiet to slightly scary feeling? I read the other Paris areas rather than policing a very good feeling. Inside the house is neat and cozy and well broke. Host quick to respond to me in a friendly and it was great. Again our doctor!"

노트르담 대성당 주변에 위치하고 있고 생재르맹 거리와 매우 인접합니다. 교통이 편리하고 엘레베이터 없는 4층이라 짐 들고 올라가는데 어려움이 있고 아파트가 작습니다. 그리고 화장실이 좁다는 단점이 있습니다.  하지만 위치도 좋고 두명이 사용하기에 적합한 곳입니다! 또한 호소트가 매우 친절합니다. 답변이 매우 빠른 편이며 불편한 사항이 있을 경우 즉각 조치를 취해줍니다.,1,estonian,Notre Dame Cathedral located in the surrounding and the current Germain Street and very close. The transportation is convenient and the Elevator have 4 layers load holding up the difficulty and the apartment is small. And the toilet is narrow.

단점이 있다면 환기가 잘 안된다는 것과 라디에이터 때문에 큰 유리창 커튼을 닫질 못해요. 그래서 혹시 옆건물 위층에서 집안 내부를 볼수 있지않을까 걱정되는정도? 그외에는 정말 마음에 들었고 다음 파리에 다시 오게된다면 또 묵고싶은 숙소입니다!",1,estonian,"This time to Europe with a stay in a love hotel. Clean and the bathroom also large and good. The subway is also close to the main subway use went. Around supermarket 2 km. The ambiance, friendly and attention to detail is everywhere in this hostel. 
There is a downside to the good ventilation should be and the radiator because of the large glass window curtain to close the have. So perhaps next building, upstairs in the house to see the inside you can not worry about that. They really liked and the next in Paris, do come back if you or silence you want to stay."

Subway or especially when using buses was convenient. The house is clean and had expected, much wider than in use. Warm water works great.

"这是一个在二区的阁楼｡因为之前没有住过阁楼,所以这间房子比我想象中要小和窄｡并且洗手间(不通风)在卧室对面(隔着一条走廊),多少有一点不方便｡另外,电梯只能到第六层,所以你需要爬一层楼,然后穿过非常长的走廊才能到房间｡但是,阁楼在最顶层,所以能看到非常好的风景,特别是在晚上的时候,月光很美｡另外,房屋沿街,还算比较安静｡

地理位置特别好,周围餐馆､超市一应俱全｡去景点基本可以步行(卢浮宫15min 歌剧院10min 去哪都比较方便)",1,estonian,"This is one of the two area attic area. Because before did not live through the loft,so this house than I imagined to be small and narrow areas. And the bathroom(not air)in the bedroom opposite(across a corridor),how much a little convenient House. In addition,the Elevator only to the sixth layer,so you need to climb one floor,and then through the very long hallway to get to rooms. However,the attic on the top floor,so you can see very good scenery,especially at night time,the moonlight is beautiful as well. In addition,houses along the street,fairly quiet area.

The location is particularly good,around restaurants, and supermarkets galore and great views. To attractions can walk(Louvre 15min Opera House 10min to go which are more convenient)"
