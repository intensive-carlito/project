"It was terrible
당일날 도착했더니 방이 꽉 차서 침대가 없다고 다른주소를 주며 거기로 오라고 통보함
무려 한달 전 쯤 예약 끝냈는데도 당일날 통보
캐리어 끌고 10분 걸어갔는데 호스트의 개인 집.
여자 혼자라 무서웠고 당황스럽고 저녁 일정 망침.
집에서 이상한 냄새나고 우중충해서 기분 상하고 진짜 너무 기분 안좋았음.
그리고 다음날엔 자리있다고 숙소로 감.
여성전용 룸 예약했고, 메세지로 미리 확인까지 하고 갔는데 여성전용 룸 꽉찼다고 공용룸에 배정해줌.
예약은 아무 상관 없음 그냥 호스트 마음대로임
최대한 사람 많이 받으려고 여성전용이고 뭐고 그냥 되는대로 끼워맞춤. 초과예약도 해서 나처럼 호스트 집에서 자고온 친구 또 있었음
그리고 셋째날 또 방 옮김. 여성전용룸 자리 하나 있다고 거기로 옮기라해서 또 옮김.

절대 예약하지마세요 너무 열악하고
호스트를 신뢰할 수 없어요
예약한건 아무 소용없어요
당일날 그냥 통보식으로
주소도 바꾸고 방도 바꾸고 여성전용이고뭐고 안지켜져요

On the day of arrival was the room full of beds and have no other address and there come and advice, including
What a month ago was book ended even on the day of the notice
Put us 10 minutes walked to the host's private home.
A woman alone was scared and embarrassed and the evening schedule hope.
At home, strange odors or and excellence in the mood and real feel too bad.
And the next day their there and the hostel.
Female only, room booking, message check up and went to bed full and public room on the ship to zoom.
Booking is nothing to do then just the host as the game
The maximum for people who receive a lot of want for women and what and just being a great fit. Exceed the reservation that I like the host at home and your friends or.
And on the third day or room to move. Female only room and there is one there, move on or move.

The absolute reservation not too harsh and
Hosts can not be trusted.
Booking conditions no use.
The same day that you just notice with
Address change and change for women and the USO, and not by.
